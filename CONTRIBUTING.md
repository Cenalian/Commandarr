# Contributing to Comandarr

There are many ways to contribute to Comandarr. Here are some of them:

* Blog about Comandarr. Tell the world how you're using Comandarr.
* Report bugs and request features in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/Comandarr/Comandarr/issues),
trying to follow the guidelines detailed in the Reporting bugs below.
* Submit patches for the new functionality and/or bug fixes. Please read the Writting Patches and
Submitting patches below for details on how to write and submit a patch.
* Join the Comandarr subreddit and share your ideas on how to improve Comandarr. We're always
open to suggestions


## Reporting Bugs

Well-written bug reports are very helpful, so keep in mind the following
guidelines when reporting a new bug.

* Check the FAQ first to see if your issue is addressed in a well-known
question.
* Check the open issues to see if it has already been reported. If it has, don't
dismiss the report but check the ticket history and comments, you may find
additional useful information to contribute.
* Search the Comandarr subreddit to see if it has been discussed there, or if
you're not sure if what you're seeing is a bug.
* Write complete, reproducible, specific bug reports. The smaller the test case,
the better. Remember that other developers won't have your project to reproduce
the bug, so please include all relevant files required to reproduce it.
* Include the version and platform the bug occured on, which is often very
helpful for reproducing it, or knowing eactly if it was already fixed.

## Writing Patches

The better written a patch is, the higher chance that it'll get accepted and the sooner that will be merged.

Well-written patches should:

* Contain the minimum amount of code required for the specific change. Small
patches are easier to review and merge. So, if you're doing more than one
change (or bug fix), please consider submitting one patch per change. Do not
collapse multiple changes into a single patch. For big changes, consider using
a patch queue.
* Pass all unit-tests, See Running tests below.
* Include one (or more) test cases that check the bug is fixed or the new
functionality added. See Writting tests below.

## Submitting Patches

The best way to submit a patch is to issue a pull request on GitHub, optionally
creating a new issue first.

Remember to explain what was fixed or the new functionality (what it is, why
it's needed, etc). The more you include, the easier it will be for core
devekioers to understand and accept your patch.

You can also discuss the new functionality (or bug fix) before creating the
patch, but it's always good to have a patch ready to illustrate your arguments
and show that you have put some additional thought into the subject. A good
starting point is to send a pull request on GitHub. It can be simple enough
to illustrate your idea, and leave documentation/tests for later, after the
idea is validated and proven useful. Alternatively, you can start a conversation
in the Comandar subreddit to discuss your idea first. When writing GitHub pull
requests, try to keep titles short but descriptive. E.g. For bug #411:
"Comandarr hangs when search for movies" prefer "Fix hanging when searching
Radarr" instead of "Fix for #411". Complete titles make it easier to skim through
the issue tracker.
