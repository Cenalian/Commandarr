If you are running Comandarr from Heroku, AWS or another web server not within
your local network, it is highly recommended that you secure your applications
behind a username and password. Luckily this feature is built into Comandarr's
integrations. Follow these steps to secure them so that only authorised users
are able to access these applications from outside your network.
